In this Chapter we describe different methods to approximate the Laplace-Beltrami operator on manifolds, with particular attention to what we will call the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian. We need now to introduce some basic concepts of Differential Geometry, especially the definition of mean curvature of a manifold and its link with the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
\subsection{Notions of Differential Geometry}

 For this short introduction to basic concepts of Differential Geometry, set the manifold $\mathcal M$ to be a differentiable, two dimensional surface embedded in $\mathbb R^3$.

 	\caption{\label{fig:curvature}Curvature normal of a manifold}
 \end{figure} 
The \textit{curvature} of a curve on a plane is defined as the inverse of the radius $R$ of the tangent circle. For each point on the manifold $\mathcal M$, define its tangent plane $H$, orthogonal to the normal vector $\mathbf n$. For every unit vector $\mathbf e_\theta$ lying on the tangent plane $H$, where $\theta$ is an angle that measures the direction on the tangent plane of $\mathbf e_\theta$, the \textit{normal curvature} $\kappa(\theta)$ is defined as the curvature of the curve that is the intersection of the manifold $\mathcal M$ and the plane containing both $\mathbf n$ and $\mathbf e_\theta$. The \textit{mean curvature} $\overline \kappa $ is defined as the average on $\theta$ of the normal curvatures:
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:mean curvature}
 	\overline \kappa=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \kappa(\theta) d \theta
 \end{equation}

It can be proved that the Laplace-Beltrami operator applied on the identity function $\mathbf x \rightarrow \mathbf x, \ \forall \mathbf x\in \mathcal M$ is directly linked to the \textit{mean curvature normal} $\overline{\kappa}\mathbf n$ by the following formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:laplacian and curvature}
	\triangle_\mathcal M \mathbf x  = -2\overline{\kappa}\mathbf n
\end{equation}
This equation provides us a way to approximate the Laplace-Beltrami operator through the approximation of the mean curvature normal. This fact is exploited by methods presented in the next section.

\subsection{Discrete Laplacians from Differential Geometry}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}

		\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/Chapter3/Voronoi}
	\end{center}
	\caption{\label{fig:Desbrun}One term of curvature normal formula and one Voronoi cell constructed around the node $x_i$}
\end{figure} 
Desbrun et al. \cite{Desbrun1999} construct a triangulation $\mathcal T_h$ with the vertices in the sampling $x_0, x_1, ..., x_{n-1}$ approximating the manifold $\mathcal M$, and then use the following discrete expression for the \textit{discrete normal curvature} $\overline{\kappa_h} \mathbf{n}$ of the manifold $\mathcal M$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:curvature normal}
	-\overline{\kappa_h} =\frac{1}{4 A_i} \sum_{j \in N_{1}(i)}\left(\cot \alpha_{ij}+\cot \beta_{ij}\right)\left(x_{j}-x_{i}\right)
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ is the area of all the triangles of the mesh sharing the node $x_i$; $N_1(i)$ is the first ring of neighbors of the i-th node; $\alpha_{i j},\ \beta_{i j}$ are the angles of the triangles of the mesh that lie on the opposite side to the edge $(i,j)$ with respect to the node $x_i$ (Figure \ref{fig:Desbrun}). Observe that for a flat surface the discrete curvature is equal to zero $\overline{\kappa_h}=0$. This is a geometric approach that relies on the intrinsic properties of the triangulation $\mathcal T_h$ and is based on the geometric meaning of the curvature normal $\overline{\kappa}$. Using equations (\ref{eq:curvature normal}) and (ref{eq:laplacian and curvature}) it can be shown \cite{REUTER2009381} that this approach leads to a \textit{discrete Laplacian} with masses $d_i=A_i$ where $A_i$ is the area of all the triangles of the mesh with a node in $x_i$, and weights
$$
w_{i j}=\frac{\cot \left(\alpha_{i j}\right)+\cot \left(\beta_{i j}\right)}{2}
$$

Meyer et al. \cite{Meyer02discretedifferential-geometry} modify the masses of Desbrun et al. and set the masses $d_i$ to be equal to $a_{V}(i)$, where \(a_{V}(i)\) is the area of the polygon obtained by joining the circumcenters of the triangles surrounding node $i$ (i.e. the Voronoi cell, figure \ref{fig:Desbrun}).

\subsection{Linear Finite Element Method Laplacian}
The eigenvalue problem (\ref{eq:continous eigenvalue problem}) can be rewritten in the equivalent weak form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weak}
	\langle \nabla f, \nabla v\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb S^2)} = \lambda \langle  f, v\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb S^2)} \quad \forall v \in L^2(\mathbb S^2)
\end{equation}
The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical algorithm that allows to calculate a discrete approximation of the solution $f$ through a functional discretization of the weak eigenvalue problem (\ref{eq:weak}). We will discuss this method deeper in section \ref{sec:Chapter3: Using the Finite Element Method to approximate the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold}. By projecting equation (\ref{eq:weak}) on a finite dimensional functional subspace of $L^2(\mathbb S^2)$ spanned by $n$ basis functions $\phi_i$, by writing $n$ times the equation (\ref{eq:weak eigenvalue problem}), setting each time the \textit{test} function $v$ equal to the $i$th basis function $\phi_i$ we obtain the generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Find }(f,\lambda)\text{ such that }A\mathbf f = \lambda B \mathbf f\\
&\begin{cases}
(A)_{ij} &= \int_{\mathbb S^2}\nabla \phi_i(\mathbf{x})\cdot \nabla \phi_j(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}\\
(B)_{ij} &= \int_{\mathbb S^2} \phi_i(\mathbf{x}) \phi_j(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}\\
(\mathbf f)_i &= f_i:\quad f(\mathbf x) = f_0\phi_0(\mathbf x)+ ... + f_{n-1}\phi_{n-1}(\mathbf x) 
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$
that can be solved through usual algebraic solvers.

\subsection{Graph Laplacian for manifolds}\label{sec:Chapter1:theoretical foundations}
In their work, Convergence of Laplacian Eigenmaps \cite{NIPS2006_2989}, Belkin et al. prove convergence of eigenvectors of the \textit{Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian} $\mathbf L_n^t$ (HKGL) of a data point cloud to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator $\Delta_\mathcal M$ on the manifold $\mathcal M$, when the data is sampled from a uniform distribution on $\mathcal M$.
For this result to hold, they suppose the manifold $\mathcal M$ to be compact, infinitely differentiable and without boundary. We just point out that being $\mathcal M$ compact, $\Delta_\mathcal M$ has a discrete spectrum. The graph they use to approximate the manifold is constructed as follows: given a sampling $ \mathcal P = \{x_i\in\mathcal M\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ on a $k$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M\subset \mathbb R^N$ they construct the full graph defined by the weights 
$$
w_{ij}=\exp\left({-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}}\right)
$$
where $\norm\cdot$ is the Euclidean norm in the ambient space $\mathbb R^N$ and whose Laplacian matrix 
$$
\mathbf L_n^t = \mathbf D-W
$$ we call \textit{Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian}.

Observe that given a function $f: \mathcal P \rightarrow \mathbb R$ defined on the sampling $ \mathcal P$ and defined the vector $\mathbf f\in\mathbb R^n$ such that $\mathbf f_i = f(x_i)$, the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian matrix acts on $\mathbf f$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:HKGL}
(\mathbf L_n^t \mathbf f)_i:=  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}}\left(f(x_i)-f(x_j)\right)
\end{equation}
This graph construction is motivated by the fact that the HKGL is nothing else than the natural discretization of the continuous \textit{functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator} $L^t:  L^{2}(\mathcal{M}) \rightarrow L^{2}(\mathcal{M})$ that is proven to converge to $\Delta_\mathcal M$.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{definition}{}(\cite[Belkin et al.]{Belkin:2005:TTF:2138147.2138189}Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator)\\ \label{eq: my L^t} Let $\mu$ be the uniform probability measure on the manifold $\mathcal M$, where $\text{vol}(\mathcal M)$ is the volume of $\mathcal M$. We define the functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator to be the operator $L^t: L^{2}(\mathcal{M}) \rightarrow L^{2}(\mathcal{M})$ such that
	\label{def:Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator}
	$$ L^tf(y) = \int_{\mathcal M}e^{-\frac{||y-x||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x)\right)d\mu(x)$$
\end{definition}
We end this Chapter by stating the theorem of spectral convergence of the HKGL to the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_\mathcal M$, that makes it a really good candidate to construct rotation invariant graphs.

\begin{snugshade*}
	\begin{theorem}(Belkin et al., \cite{NIPS2006_2989})\label{theo:spectral convergence}
		Let \(\lambda_{n, i}^{t}\) be the $i$th eigenvalue of 
		$$
		\frac{(4\pi t)^{-(k+2)/2}}{n}\mathbf L^t_n
		$$
		and \(\mathbf v_{n, i}^{t}\) be the corresponding eigenvector. Let \(\lambda_{i}\) and \(v_{i}\) be the corresponding eigenvalue and eigenfunction of \(\Delta\) respectively. Then there exists a sequence \(t_{n} \rightarrow 0,\) such that
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{array}{c}{\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \lambda_{n, i}^{t_{n}}=\lambda_{i}} \\ 
		{\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left\|\mathbf v_{n, i}^{t_{n}}-v_{i}(\mathbf x)\right\|_{2}=0}\end{array}
		\end{equation}
		where the limits are in probability.
