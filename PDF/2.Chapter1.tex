\section{Better Graph Spherical Convolutions}
[Stating the problem we want to solve]\\
Deferrard et al. \cite{DeepSphere} proposed a graph convolutional neural network that is almost equivariant to rotations, but limit the computational complexity of the algorithm to be linear with the dimension of the input data. They take inspiration from the work of Belkin et al. \cite{Belkin:2005:TTF:2138147.2138189} to define suitable weights to connect the pixels of the input image in order to obtain a graph whose convolution approximates the convolution on a sphere. Despite Belkin et al. proved a result of spectral convergence of their graph Laplacian to the Laplace-Beltrami operator for any manifold given a random sampling \cite{NIPS2006_2989}, in the work of Defferrard et al. the graph Laplacian does not show the expected spectral convergence to the continuous Laplace-Beltrami operator. 

[Stating what we did to solve it]\\
In this chapter we give three contributions to this problem: first, in section \ref{sec:pointwise convergence of the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian on the Sphere} we prove a pointwise convergence result of the full graph Laplacian in the case of the sphere on a deterministic sampling that is regular enough, then in section \ref{sec:How to build a good graph} we show a way of modifying the graph of Defferrard et al. to recover the expected convergence and still containing the computational costs of graph convolutions, and finally in section \ref{sec:Experimental validation} we study how the graph proposed in section \ref{sec:How to build a good graph} performs in practice when used in a Graph Convolutional Neural Network, comparing its performances to the original graph presented in \cite{DeepSphere}.

\subsection{Definitions and basic results}
[ I'll move this section to the previous Chapter when introducing the work of Belkin et al. For now I'll leave it here for completeness]\\
Let us recall some basic definitions necessary for this chapter:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{definition}{}(Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian Matrix)\\
	\label{def:Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian Matrix}
	Given a sampling $ \mathcal P = \{x_i\in\mathcal M\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ on a $k$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M\subset \mathbb R^N$ we construct the full graph defined by the adjacency matrix 
	$$(\mathbf W)_{ij}=e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}}$$
	 where $||\cdot||$ is the Euclidean norm in the ambient space $\mathbb R^N$ and we define the corresponding Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian by the \textbf{matrix} 
    $$(\mathbf{L}_n^t)_{ij}=\begin{cases}
    \sum_k W_{ik} & \text{if }i=j\\
    -W_{ij}&\text{if }i\neq j
    \end{cases}$$
\end{definition}
\vspace{0.5cm}
Observe that given a function $f: \mathcal P \rightarrow \mathbb R$ defined on the sampling $ \mathcal P$ and defined the vector $\mathbf f\in\mathbb R^n$ such that $\mathbf f_i = f(x_i)$, the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian matrix acts on $\mathbf f$ in the following way:
$$ (\mathbf L_n^t \mathbf f)_i:=  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}}\left(f(x_i)-f(x_j)\right)$$

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{definition}{}(Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator)\\
	\label{def:Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator}
	\text{Given a sampling $\{x_i\in\mathcal M\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of the manifold we define the \textbf{operator} }$L_n^t$ such that
	$$L_n^tf(y) := \frac{1}{n}\left[ \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x_i)\right)\right]$$
\end{definition}
\vspace{0.5cm}
Observe that the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator restricted on the sample points $x_0, ..., x_{n-1}$ acts as the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian matrix rescaled by a factor of $\frac{1}{n}$:
$$L_n^tf(x_i) = \frac{1}{n}\mathbf (L_n^t\mathbf f)_i$$
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{definition}{}(Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator)\\ \label{eq: my L^t} Let $\mu$ be the uniform probability measure on the manifold $\mathcal M$, that is the probability measure given by the induced metric on $\mathcal M$ rescaled by a factor $\frac{1}{|\mathcal M|}$, where $|\mathcal M|$ is the volume of $\mathcal M$. We define the functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator to be the operator $L^t$ such that
	\label{def:Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator}
	$$ L^tf(y) = \int_{\mathcal M}e^{-\frac{||y-x||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x)\right)d\mu(x)$$
\end{definition}
\vspace{0.5cm}
We conclude by stating a result that we will need in the next section:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{prop}(Hoeffding's inequality)\\
	Let \(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}\) be independent identically distributed random variables, such that
	\(\left|X_{i}\right| \leqslant K .\) Then
	
	$$
	\mathbb P\left\{\left|\frac{\sum_{i} X_{i}}{n}-\mathbb{E} X_{i}\right|>\epsilon\right\}<2 \exp \left(-\frac{\epsilon^{2} n}{2 K^{2}}\right)
	$$
	\label{theo:Hoeffding}
\end{prop}
\subsection{Pointwise convergence of the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian on the Sphere}
\label{sec:pointwise convergence of the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian on the Sphere}
[Review of Belkin et al's proof]\\ 
Belkin et al. prove the following pointwise convergence result for the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator built on a random sampling on any $k$-dimensional compact smooth manifold $\mathcal M$ embedded in some euclidean space $\mathbb R^N$:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{theorem}{from \cite[Belkin et al.]{Belkin:2005:TTF:2138147.2138189}}\\
	\label{theo:Belkin pointwise convergence}
	Let $\mathcal M$ be a $k$-dimensional compact smooth manifold embedded in some euclidean space $\mathbb R^N$. Let the data points $x_1, ... x_n$ be sampled form a uniform distribution on the manifold $\mathcal M$. Set $t_n=n^{-\frac{1}{k+2+\alpha}}$, for any $\alpha>0$ and let $f\in\mathcal C_\infty(\mathcal M)$. Then:
	
	$$\forall \epsilon>0\quad \mathbb{P}\left[\left|\frac{1}{t}\frac{1}{(4 \pi t)^{k/2}}L_{n}^{t_n} f(p)-  \frac{1}{|\mathcal M|}L^{t_n} f(p)\right|>\epsilon\right] \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} 0$$
\end{theorem}
\vspace{0.5cm}

In this section we'll prove a similar result but on the specific case of the manifold $\mathcal M$ being the 2-Sphere $\mathcal S_2$ where the points $x_1, ..., x_n$ are not sampled form a random distribution on the manifold, but are defined by the HEALPix sampling defined in section \ref{sec:HEALPix}. Since our result is similar to theorem \ref{theo:Belkin pointwise convergence}, it is useful to first review the proof of theorem \ref{theo:Belkin pointwise convergence} before stating the main result of this section.
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{theo:Belkin pointwise convergence}]
The first step is to observe that for any fixed $t>0$, any fixed function $f$ and a fixed point $y\in\mathcal S_2$,  the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian $L_n^t$ is an unbiased estimator for the Functional Approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami $L^t$. In other words, $L_n^tf(y)$ is the empirical average of $n$ i.i.d. random variables $X_i= e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x_i)\right)$ with expected value corresponding to $L^tf(y)$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expected value of heat kernel grah laplacian}
	\mathbb E L_n^tf(y) = L^tf(y)
\end{equation}
Thus, for the strong law of large numbers we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:convergence in probability}
\lim_{n\to\infty}L_n^tf(y) = L^t(y)
\end{equation}
where the limit is in the sense of the strong law of large numbers.
The core of the work of Belkin et al. is the proof, that we will not discuss, of the following proposition:

\begin{prop} Under the same hypothesis of theorem \ref{theo:Belkin pointwise convergence},
	$$\frac{1}{t}\frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{k/2}} L^tf(y) \xrightarrow{t\to 0 } \frac{1}{|\mathcal M|}\triangle_{\mathcal M}f(y)$$
	\label{prop:3}
\end{prop}

Thanks to Proposition \ref{prop:3} and equation \ref{eq:convergence in probability}, a straightforward application of Hoeffding's inequality with $K=\frac{1}{t}\frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{k/2}}$ together with equation  \ref{eq:expected value of heat kernel grah laplacian} leads to

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:hoeffding applied}
	\mathbb{P}\left[\frac{1}{t(4 \pi t)^{k / 2}}\left|L_{n}^{t} f(y)- L^{t} f(y)\right|>\epsilon\right] \leq 2 e^{-1 / 2 \epsilon^{2} n t(4 \pi t)^{k / 2}}
\end{equation}

We want the right hand side of equation \ref{eq:hoeffding applied} to go to $0$ for $n\to\infty, t\to0$ at the same time. For this to happen, we need to find a sequence $(t_n)$ such that 
$$\begin{cases}
t_n\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\\
2 e^{-1 / 2 \epsilon^{2} n t_n(4 \pi t_n)^{k / 2}}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}0\\
\end{cases}$$

By fixing $t_n=n^{-\frac{1}{k+2+\alpha}}$, for any $\alpha>0$, it is easy to check that $-1 / 2 \epsilon^{2} n t_n(4 \pi t_n)^{k / 2}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}+\infty$ concluding the proof.

\end{proof}

Now we can observe that in order to adapt this proof to the case of the sphere with the HEALPix sampling  we need to modify two key things. First, due to the deterministic nature of the HEALPix sampling on the sphere, we need to prove that for any fixed $t>0$, any fixed function $f$ and any point $y\in\mathcal S_2$ 
$$\left|L_n^tf(y)-L^tf(y)\right|\xrightarrow{n\to \infty} 0$$
without relying on the strong law of large numbers. Once proven such result, we need to prove that

$$\left|\frac{1}{4\pi t^2}\left(L_n^tf(x) - L^tf(x)\right)\right|\xrightarrow[n\to \infty]{t\to 0}0$$

and then use Proposition \ref{prop:3} to prove our main result, stated hereunder:
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{theorem}
	For a sampling $\mathcal P = \{x_i\in\mathcal S_2\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of the sphere, for all $f: \mathcal S_2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ Lipschitz with respect to the euclidean distance, for all $y\in\mathcal S_2$, the rescaled Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator $\frac{|\mathcal S_2|}{4\pi t_n}L^t_n$ converges pointwise to the Laplace Beltrami operator on the sphere $\triangle_{\mathcal M}$
	
	$$ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{|\mathcal S_2|}{4\pi t_N^2} L_n^{t_N}f(y) =  \triangle_{\mathcal S_2}f(y) $$
	\label{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case}
\end{theorem}
\vspace{1cm}

Before showing the proof, we need to define some geometrical quantities that we'll need.
Given a HEALPix sampling $x_0, ..., x_{n-1}$ define $N$ to be a shorthand for the HEALPix parameter $N_{side}$ (remember that for HEALPix sampling, $n=12N^2$). Define $\sigma_i$ to be the patch of the surface of the sphere corresponding to the i-th point of the sampling, define $A_i$ to be its corresponding area and $d_i$ to be the radius of the smallest ball in $\mathbb R^3$ containing the i-th patch (see Figure \ref{fig:Geometric characteristics of a patch}). Define $d^{(n)} := \max_{i=0, ..., n}d_i$ and $A^{(n)}=\max_{i=0, ..., n}A_i$.\\

\subsubsection{Proof of the pointwise convergence of the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian on the Sphere}

As an intermediate result to the main result proved in Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case}, our first goal is to prove that 
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:1}
	For a sampling $\{x_i\in\mathcal S_2\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of the sphere, for all $f: \mathcal S_2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ Lipschitz with respect to the euclidean distance $||\cdot||$, for all $y\in\mathcal S_2$, the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator $L^t_n$ converges pointwise to the functional approximation of the Laplace Beltrami operator $L^t$
	$$ L_n^tf(y)\xrightarrow{n\to\infty} L^tf(y)$$
\end{prop} 
\vspace{0.5cm}


\begin{proof}
	We know by construction that the HEALPix sampling cut the sphere into equal areas. Given a HEALPix sampling $\{x_i\in\mathcal S_2\}_{i=0}^{n-1},\ n=12N^2,\ N=2^k,\ k\in\mathbb N$, we can define $S_n: \ A_i=S_n=\frac{|\mathcal S_2|}{n}\ \forall i=1, ..., n$.
	Let us assume that the function $f$ is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant $\mathcal L_f$, we have 
	
	$$\left| \int_{A_{i}}f({\bf x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}f(\mathbf x_i)\right| \leq \mathcal L_fd_{n}\frac{1}{n} $$

	So, by triangular inequality and by summing all the contributions of all the $n$ patches
	$$\left| \int_{\mathcal S_2}f({\bf x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}\sum_i f(\mathbf x_i)\right| \leq \sum_i \left| \int_{\sigma_{i}}f({\bf x})\text{d}{\mu(x)} - \frac{1}{n}f(\mathbf x_i)\right|\leq n  \mathcal L_fd_{n}\frac{1}{n} = \mathcal L_fd_{n}$$	
	Thanks to this result, we have the following two pointwise convergences
	
	$$\forall f \text{ Lipschiz,}\quad \forall y\in\mathcal S_2,  \quad\quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_i e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}\rightarrow \int e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}d\mu(x)$$
	$$\forall f \text{ Lipschiz,}\quad \forall y\in\mathcal S_2,  \quad\quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_i e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}f(x_i)\rightarrow \int e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}f(x)d\mu(x)$$
	
	Together with definitions \ref{def:Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator} and \ref{def:Functional approximation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator} this end the proof.
\end{proof}
\vspace{0.5cm}

Now, we just proved that \textit{keeping t fixed} $L_n^tf(x)\rightarrow L^tf(x)$. Now our goal is to prove that:

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:2}
	Given a sampling regular enough i.e. for which we assume $d^{(n)}\leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$, for a fixed $t>0$, a fixed Lipschitz function $f$ and a fixed point $y\in\mathcal S_2$
$$\left|\frac{1}{4\pi t^2}\left(L_n^tf(x) -L^tf(x)\right)\right|\rightarrow0$$
\textit{for $t\to0$ and $n\to\infty$ at the same time}. In other words, there exists a sequence $(t_n), \\ \lim_{n\to\infty}t_n=0$ such that 
$$\forall f \text{ Lipschitz, } \forall x\in\mathcal S_2 \quad \left|\frac{1}{4\pi t_n^2}\left(L_n^{t_n}f(x) - L^{t_n}f(x)\right)\right|\xrightarrow{n\to \infty}0$$
\end{prop}
\vspace{0.5cm}

The main result of this section, theorem  \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case}, is then an immediate consequence of Proposition \ref{prop:2} and Proposition \ref{prop:3}.


\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:2}]
	
	We define for simplicity of notation
	$$\phi^t(x;y) := e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x)\right)$$
	$$K^t(x,y) :=  e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}$$

	
	we start by writing the following chain of inequalities
	$$||L_n^tf-L^tf||_\infty = \max _{y\in \mathcal S_2} \left|L_n^tf(y)-L^tf(y)\right|=$$
	$$= \max _{y\in \mathcal S_2} \left| \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \phi^t(x_i; y)- \int_{\mathcal S_2} \phi^t(x;y)d\mu(x) \right|$$
	$$\leq \max _{y\in \mathcal S_2}  \sum_{i=1}^n   \left| \frac{1}{n}  \phi^t(x_i; y)- \int_{\sigma_i} \phi^t(x;y)d\mu(x) \right|$$

	$$\leq  \max _{y\in \mathcal S_2} \left[\mathcal L_{\phi^t_y}d^{(n)} \right]$$
	
	where $\mathcal L_{\phi^t_y}$ is the Lipschitz constant of $x \rightarrow \phi^t(x, y)$ and where we used for the last inequality the arguments used in Step 1. If we assume $d^{(n)}\leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$ and remember that for HEALPix $n=12N^2$ we have that
	
	$$||L_n^tf-L^tf||_\infty  \leq  \max _{y\in \mathcal S_2} \left[ \mathcal L_{\phi^t_y} \frac{C}{N} \right]$$
	
	Let's now find the explicit dependence $t\rightarrow \mathcal L_{\phi^t_y}$
	
	$\mathcal L_{\phi^t_y} = ||\partial_x\phi^t(x;y)||_\infty = ||\partial_x\left(K^t(x;y)f(x)\right)||_\infty = ||\partial_x K^t(x;y)f(x) + K^t(x;y)\partial_x f(x)||_\infty \leq$
	
	$ \leq ||\partial_x K^t(x;y)f(x)||_\infty + ||K^t(x;y)\partial_x f(x)||_\infty \leq  ||\partial_x K^t(x;y)||_\infty||f(x)||_\infty + ||K^t(x;y)||_\infty||\partial_x f(x)||_\infty = $
	
	$ = ||\partial_x K^t(x;y)||_\infty||f(x)||_\infty + ||\partial_x f(x)||_\infty = \mathcal L_{K^t_y} ||f||_\infty + ||\partial_xf||_\infty = \mathcal L_{K^t_y} ||f||_\infty + \mathcal L_f$
	
	where $\mathcal L_{K^t_y}$ is the Lipschitz constant of $x\rightarrow K^t(x;y)$. We can observe that such constant does not depend on $y$. Thus
	
	$\mathcal L_{K^t_y} = \norm{\partial_x e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}_\infty = \norm{\frac{x}{2t}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}}_\infty = \left. \frac{x}{2t}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}\right|_{x=\sqrt{2t}}=(2et)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\propto t ^ {-\frac{1}{2}}$
	
	So we can continue
	
	$$ \max _{y\in \mathcal S_2} \left[  \mathcal L_{\phi^t_y} \frac{C}{N} \right]\leq$$
	$$ \leq \left[   \frac{C}{N} \left( (2et)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \norm{f}_\infty + \mathcal L_f \right)\right]\leq$$
	$$  \leq \frac{C\norm{f}_\infty}{N(2et)^\frac{1}{2}} +   \frac{C}{N}\mathcal L_f$$
	
	So we have that, rescaling by a factor $\frac{1}{4\pi t^2}$
	
	$$\norm{\frac{1}{4\pi t^2}\left(L_n^tf-L^tf\right)}_\infty\leq$$
	$$\leq \frac{1}{4\pi t^2}\norm{\left(L_n^tf-L^tf\right)}_\infty \leq$$
	$$ \leq \frac{C}{4\pi}\left[\frac{\norm{f}_\infty}{\sqrt{2e}}\frac{1}{Nt^\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{\mathcal L_f}{Nt^2}\right]$$
	
	we want $\begin{cases}
	t \rightarrow 0\\
	N \rightarrow \infty\\
	Nt^\frac{5}{2} \rightarrow \infty\\
	Nt^2 \rightarrow \infty
	\end{cases}$ in order for $ \frac{C}{4\pi}\left[\frac{\norm{f}_\infty}{\sqrt{2e}}\frac{1}{Nt^\frac{5}{2}} + \frac{\mathcal L_f}{Nt^2}\right] \xrightarrow[t\to 0 ]{N\to\infty}0$
	
	This is true if $\begin{cases}
	t(N) = N^\beta, &\beta\in(-\frac{2}{5}, 0) \\
	t(N) = N^\beta, &\beta\in(-\frac{1}{2}, 0)
	\end{cases} \implies t(N) = N^\beta, \quad \beta\in(-\frac{2}{5}, 0)$
	
	Indeed 
	
	$Nt^\frac{5}{2}=N^{\frac{5}{2}\beta+1}\xrightarrow{N \to \infty} \infty$ since $\frac{5}{2}\beta+1>0 \iff \beta>-\frac{2}{5}$
	
	$Nt^2=N^{2\beta+1}\xrightarrow {N \to \infty} \infty$ since $2\beta+1>0 \iff \beta>-\frac{1}{2}$
	
	So, for $t=N^\beta$ with $\beta\in(-\frac{2}{5}, 0)$ we have that 
	
	$$\begin{cases}
	(t_N)\xrightarrow{N\to\infty}0\\
	\norm{\frac{1}{4\pi t_N^2}L_n^{t_N}f-\frac{1}{4\pi t_N^2}L^{t_N}f}_\infty  \xrightarrow{N\to\infty}0
	\end{cases}$$
	
\end{proof}

The proof of theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case} is now trivial:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case}]
	Thanks to Proposition \ref{prop:2} and Proposition \ref{prop:3}	we conclude that $\forall y\in\mathcal S_2 $
	$$\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi t_N^2} L_n^{t_N}f(y) =  \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi t_N^2} L^{t_N}f(y) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal S_2|}\triangle_{\mathcal S_2}f(y) $$
\end{proof}


[Why proving this result is useful] The proof of this result is instructive since it shows that we need to impose some regularity conditions on the sampling. If the sampling is equal area (i), meaning that all the patches $\sigma_i$ have the same area (i.e. HEALPix, see figure \ref{fig:HEALPix equal areas patches}), then we need to impose that $ d^{(n)}\leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. If the sampling is not equal area (ii), meaning that in general $A_i\neq A_j$, it can be shown that we need a slightly more complex condition: $\max_{i=0,...,n-1}d_iA_i\leq C\frac{1}{n^\frac{3}{2}}$.\\
In \cite{Belkin:2005:TTF:2138147.2138189} the sampling is drawn form a uniform random distribution on the sphere, and their proof heavily relies on the uniformity properties of the distribution from which the sampling is drawn. In our case the sampling is deterministic, and the fact that for a sphere there doesn't exist a regular sampling with more than 12 points (being the only regular samplings of the sphere the vertices of the Platonic solids) is indeed a problem that we need to overcome someway by having to impose the regularity conditions above. 


To conclude, we can see that the result obtained has the same form than the result obtained in \cite{Belkin:2005:TTF:2138147.2138189}. If Belkin et al. proved convergence in the random case for $\beta \in (-\frac{1}{4}, 0)$, we proved convergence in the HEALPix case for $\beta \in (-\frac{2}{5}, 0)$. This kind of result can be interpreted in the following way. In order to have convergence, we need to reduce the kernel width but \textit{not so fast} compared to the resolution of the graph. In other words, the kernel width has to be reduced but is somewhat limited by the resolution of the graph, that has to increase faster than $t^\frac{2}{5}$ goes to $0$.\\
\begin{remark}
	Pointwise convergence is just a necessary condition for spectral convergence.  Theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case} do not imply convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\end{remark}

\subsection{How to build a good graph}
\label{sec:How to build a good graph}
Current state of the art: DeepSphere.
Problems: we don't see the convergence expected. in figure \ref{fig:deepsphere results} we see that as $N_{side}$ grows, the eigenspaces of the graph Laplacian do not get more and more aligned with the eigenspaces spanned by the spherical harmonics, as we expected. Why? The parameters to choose are the following: the number of pixels $n$, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel $t$ and the number of neighbors of the graph. We'll see that the main cause of this bad behavior is the fixed number of neighbors used in \cite{DeepSphere} for the construction of the graph. We'll see that to obtain the desired convergence it is necessary to increase the number of neighbors as we decrease $t$, as we can show hereunder. We'll follow in practice what we did in the proof of theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case}: first we'll make n go to infinity, analyze the results, then we'll try to find a possible sequence if $t_n$ in order to obtain the expected convergence and finally we'll find a way to sparsify the graph to limit as much as possible the computational costs of graph convolutions but keeping it as close as possible to the full graph's one.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Full graph, $n\to\infty$}\label{sec:Chapter1: n to infty}
As we saw in the proof of theorem \ref{theo:pointwise convergence in the healpix case} we need 2 convergences in order for it to work: first we need the pointwise convergence for a fixed $t$, for a fixed $f$, for a fixed $y$, of the Heat Kernel Graph Laplacian operator to the functional approximation of the Laplacian operator 
$$L_n^tf(y)\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}L^tf(y)$$
Remember that we are interested in a much stronger convergence, that is spectral convergence. For this we'll do our empirical convergence analysis directly on the spectrum of the matrix. 
Let's see what happens when we fix $t$ and let n go to infinity:

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../codes/02.HeatKernelGraphLaplacian/HEALPix/06_figures/n_eigenvalues.png}	
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:n to infinity1} and in figure \ref{fig:n to infinity2} we see two things: first that there's a frequency threshold beyond which the Graph Laplacian is completely "blind", approximately located at the 15th degree, and second that before this frequency threshold, we actually see the convergence expected: the alignment get better and better as $n$ gets bigger. This can be explained as follows: with a fixed $t$, we have a corresponding fixed radius $r_t$ inside which a lot of pixels $\norm{x_0-x_j}\leq r,\ \norm{x_0-x_i}\leq r \implies -\frac{\norm{x_0-x_j}}{4t} \approxeq -\frac{\norm{x_0-x_i}}{4t} \implies W_{0j}\approxeq W_{0i}$ and thus any frequency with wavelength shorter than the radius $r$ becomes "invisible" to the graph Laplacian. This threshold can be seen also in the spectrum represented in figure \ref{fig:n to infinity3}: as $n$ gets bigger the eigenvalues get more and more grouped in the usual groups that identify the well known spherical harmonics; however, there's a point around the 15th degree  from which all the eigenspaces merge into one, corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$. This again can be interpreted as the inability of the graph to see frequencies above the threshold because of the reasons explained above.
 
\subsubsection{Full graph, $t\to 0$}
Intuition: with a big $t$, the kernel is very wide and the graph can not distinguish the high frequencies. Thus, above a certain frequency where the variations reach a wavelength $\omega \leq \bar d$, any graph operator would be blind to such frequencies (indeed, any reordering of the signal on the neighbors would lead to the same result). Thus, if we want our graph Laplacian to be able to distinguish more and more frequencies, we need our weights to change significantly in a shorter and shorter radius.
Let's see what happens with a fixed $n$ and making $t\to0$:

	\caption{Second trend: error stays low for low frequencies, but start getting higher for high frequencies}
	\label{fig:t_sensitivity_diagonal_2}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
\end{figure}
Results are in figure \ref{fig:t_sensitivity_eigenspaces}, \ref{fig:t_sensitivity_diagonal}. We can see that for the smallest values of $t$, we have bad alignment both in high and in low frequencies: for $t$ that gets bigger and bigger up to $t=0.05$, we get better alignment both in high and low frequencies (Figure \ref{fig:t_sensitivity_diagonal_1}).  After that threshold, we can see that the error in the high frequencies starts to get bigger again, while the error in the low frequencies keeps staying low (Figure \ref{fig:t_sensitivity_diagonal_2}). This again can be explained with the same arguments used in the section \ref{sec:Chapter1: n to infty}: low values of the kernel width correspond to a very peaked kernel, that causes the weights to be close to zero and thus the graph becomes less and less connected loosing every capability of identifying different frequencies; on the opposite side high values of the kernel width correspond to a very flat kernel, and thus the graph loses the capacity of individuating high frequencies;

\subsubsection{Putting it together: full graph, $n\to\infty$ and $t\to 0$}
A quick heuristic grid search has been used to find the following optimal parameters for different values of $N_{side}$ in the case of a full graph. The optimal values of the kernel width $t$ are shown in figure \ref{fig:t}, and the usual alignment plots in figures \ref{fig:optimal graph}, \ref{fig:optimal graph diagonal}. We can see in figure \ref{fig:t} that the heuristic way of \cite{DeepSphere} of setting the standard deviation $t$ produces results very close to the optimal value. We recall that in DeepSphere $t$ is set to the average of the non zeros weight matrix entries, where the number of neighbors of each node is fixed between 7 and 8.

\subsubsection{Reducing the number of neighbors}
For what it concerns how to make the graph sparse, the intuition is the following: remember that we want our graph Laplacian to approximate the operator $L^t$
$$\frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_i e^{-\frac{||x_i-y||^2}{4t}}(f(y)-f(x_i)) \right) \approx \int_\mathcal M e^{-\frac{||x-y||^2}{4t}}\left(f(y)-f(x)\right)d\mu(x) $$

However, with a full graph the operation of filtering with a polynomial of the graph Laplacian would cost $\mathcal O (n^2)$, same order of magnitude of the method proposed in \cite{bibid}. We want a method to make the graph sparse such that the number of non-null entries of the Laplacian is linear $\mathcal O (n)$, making the filtering operation $f\rightarrow \mathcal P(L)f$ linear in the number of pixels. Deferrard et al. \cite{bibid} fixed the number of neighbors to 7/8. However, their results do not show the expected spectral convergence.
Making the graph sparse means approximating some weights $w_{i,j}=e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}} \approx 0$. For this to be accurate we need those weights to be close to 0. A method to be sure that the approximation isn't too bad is the following: \textbf{instead of fixing the number of neighbors, fixing a threshold $k$ on $w_{i,j}=e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}}$ such that} 

$$w_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}}\quad& \text{if } e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}} \geq k\\
0 \quad & \text{if } e^{-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{4t}} < k
\end{cases}$$

By setting $k = 0.01$ here's the results:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ c|c} 
		
		$N_{side}$ & Number of neighbors \\ 
		
		1 & 11 \\ 
		2 & 16 \\ 
		4 & 37 \\ 
		8 & 43 \\ 
		16 & 52 \\ 
		
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\label{fig:optimal_thresholded}
	\caption{Optimal construction \textbf{thresholded at $k=0.01$}}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../codes/02.HeatKernelGraphLaplacian/HEALPix/06_figures/optimal_thresholded.png}	
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../codes/02.HeatKernelGraphLaplacian/HEALPix/06_figures/optimal_thresholded_diagonal.png}	
\end{figure}

We see that to keep the threshold fixed we need to increase the number of neighbors as $N_{side}$ gets bigger. Again, the intuition is the following: to have spectral convergence (a strong type of convergence) we need more and more global information and more precise.
