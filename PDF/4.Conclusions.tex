\section{Conclusions: how to include geometrical information about the Sphere in a topological object: the graph}\label{sec:Chapter4}
[Working on it right now. Here I compare FEM and Graph approach, talk about what we learned from FEM to answer to the research question: "How to include geometrical information about the Sphere in a topological object: the graph". Here I hope to say something cool and not too obvious. Three pages?]
